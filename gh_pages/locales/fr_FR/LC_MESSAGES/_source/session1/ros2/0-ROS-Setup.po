"In a \"bare\" ROS install, you will need to run the \"source\" command on"

"project only uses a single distribution, it can be helpful to configure "
"our ~/.bashrc file to automatically source this setup file for each new "
"terminal window.  See here for details. If you will be using multiple ROS"
" distributions on one machine, then you do NOT want this auto-sourcing "
"behavior. The auto-sourcing will always source the same distribution, and"
" sourcing another distribution after this can cause issues. This will not"
" be an issue in this class as we will exclusively using ROS 2 Humble."
