"Many of the coolest and most useful capabilities of ROS already exist "

"downloadable debian packages. Alternately, some resources are less tested"
" or more \"cutting edge\" and have not reached a stable release state; "
"you can still access many of these resources by downloading them from "
"their repository (usually housed on Github). Getting these git packages "
"takes a few more steps than the debian packages. In this module we will "
