"The ROS architecture encourages engineers to use ''nodes'' as a "
"fundamental unit of organization in their systems, and applications can "
"quickly grow to require many nodes to operate. Opening a new terminal and"
" running each node individually quickly becomes unfeasible. It'd be nice "
"to have a tool to bring up groups of nodes at once. ROS ''launch'' files "
"are one such tool."
