"The first type of ROS communication that we explored was a one-way "
"interaction called messages which are sent over channels called topics. "
"Now we are going to explore a different communication type, which is a "
"two-way interaction via a request from one node to another and a response"
" from that node to the first. In this module we will create a service "
"server (waits for request and comes up with response) and client (makes "
"request for info then waits for response)."
