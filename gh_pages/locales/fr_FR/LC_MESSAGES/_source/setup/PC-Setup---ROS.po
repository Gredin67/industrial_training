"There are two options for utilizing the ROS-Industrial training "
"materials.  The first recommended option is to utilize a pre-configured "
"virtual machine.  The second option is to install a native Ubuntu machine"
" with the required software.  The virtual machine approach is by far the "
"easiest option and ensures the fewest build errors during training but is"
" limited in its ability to connect to certain hardware, particularly over"
" USB (i.e. kinect-like devices)."
