"For this tutorial, we will use a Schunk WSG050 gripper. We will "
"communicate with this gripper via Ethernet TCP/IP. However, the ROS "
"driver hides most of the details of this interface, allowing us to "
"control it without in-depth knowledge of TCP/IP. Further, it is worth "
"noting that there are at least 2 community supported ROS drivers that "
"provide different interfaces. We will demonstrate only the first one."
