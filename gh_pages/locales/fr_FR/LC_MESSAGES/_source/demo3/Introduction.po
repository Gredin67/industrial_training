"The purpose of these exercises is to implement a ROS node that drives a "
"robot through a series of moves and actions in order to complete a pick "
"and place task. In addition, they will serve as an example of how to "
"utilize more specialized tools such as the optimization based path "
"planner, TrajOpt, and the control interfaces of the KUKA iiwa robot, "
"while also integrating a variety of software capabilities (perception, "
"controller drivers, I/O, inverse kinematics, path planning, collision "
"avoidance, etc) into a ROS-based industrial application."
