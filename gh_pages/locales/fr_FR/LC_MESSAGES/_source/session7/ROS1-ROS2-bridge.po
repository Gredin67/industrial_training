"This is a system integration exercise to demonstrate operation of the "
"ROS1-ROS2 topic and service bridge. Using the bridge does not require new"
" techniques when developing either ROS1 or ROS2 software, so much of the "
"required code is provided to you in a template workspace "
"(~/industrial_training/exercises/7.2/template_ws/src). Instead, we will "
"focus on developing code that interfaces with the ros1_bridge package."

"In this exercise, the ROS1 ARMarker message, which is the goal "
"destination for the robot, must be communicated to the ROS2 application. "
"Then, the ROS2 application needs to use service clients to call a planner"
" that only exists as a ROS1 package. Specifically, this exercise calls "
"the Descartes motion planner as seen in Exercise 4.1. On the ROS1 side, "
"service servers are provided to generate motion plans and to execute "
"them. In order to use these custom services, the bridge needs to be "
"compiled from source with the message definitions in the build "
"environment, which is the bulk of the complexity in this exercise."
