"In this exercise, we will move the robot through the pick motion while "
"avoiding obstacles in the environment. This will be accomplished by "
"planning for each pose and closing or opening the vacuum gripper when "
"appropriate. Also, we will demonstrate how to create a motion plan that "
"MoveIt! can understand and solve."
