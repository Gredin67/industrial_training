"The purpose of these exercises is to implement a ROS node that drives a "
"robot through a series of moves and actions in order to complete a pick "
"and place task.  In addition, they will serve as an example as to how to "
"integrate a variety of software capabilities (perception, controller "
"drivers, I/O, inverse kinematics, path planning, collision avoidance, "
"etc) into a ROS-based industrial application."
