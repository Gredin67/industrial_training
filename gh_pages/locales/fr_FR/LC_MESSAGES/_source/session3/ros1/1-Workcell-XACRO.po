"Writing URDFs that involve more than just a few elements can quickly "
"become a pain. Your file gets huge and duplicate items in your workspace "
"means copy-pasting a bunch of links and joints while having to change "
"their names just slightly. It’s really easy to make a mistake that may "
"(or may not) be caught at startup. It’d be nice if we could take some "
"guidance from programming languages themselves: define a component once, "
"then re-use it anywhere without excessive duplication. Functions and "
"classes do that for programs, and XACRO macros do that for URDFs. XACRO "
"has other cool features too, like a file include system (think #include),"
" constant variables, math expression evaluation (e.g., say PI/2.0 instead"
" of 1.57), and more."

"If you explore the UR5 definition file, or just about any other file that"

"(ala-global variables) or macro parameters. Most macros will take a "
