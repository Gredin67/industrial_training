"Many of the coolest and most useful capabilities of ROS and its community"
" involve things like collision checking and dynamic path planning. It’s "
"frequently useful to have a code-independent, human-readable way to "
"describe the geometry of robots and their cells. Think of it like a "
"textual CAD description: “part-one is 1 meter left of part-two and has "
"the following triangle-mesh for display purposes.” The Unified Robot "
"Description Format (URDF) is the most popular of these formats today. "
"This module will walk you through creating a simple robot cell that we’ll"
" expand upon and use for practical purposes later."
