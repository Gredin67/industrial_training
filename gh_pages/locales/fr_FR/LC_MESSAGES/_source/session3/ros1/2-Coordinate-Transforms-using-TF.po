"It’s hard to imagine a useful, physical “robot” that doesn’t move itself "
"or watch something else move. A useful application in ROS will inevitably"
" have some component that needs to monitor the position of a part, robot "
"link, or tool. In ROS, the “eco-system” and library that facilitates this"
" is called TF. TF is a fundamental tool that allows for the lookup the "
"transformation between any connected frames, even back through time. It "
"allows you to ask questions like: “What was the transform between A and B"
" 10 seconds ago.” That’s useful stuff."
